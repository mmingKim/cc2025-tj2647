Concept：
In this project, I connect breathing with time to express how every second we live is like an inhale and exhale.

When the mouse is pressed, a new “time text” object is created using Matter.Bodies.rectangle().
This text falls naturally under gravity, defined by the Matter.js physics engine (World.add(world, body)), allowing each timestamp to behave like a physical object that exists in space and accumulates at the bottom.
