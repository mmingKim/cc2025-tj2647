# Heading1 Patrick Lin, Why We’re Not Using AI in This Course, Despite Its Obvious Benefits

> *Also, it should be noted that users who generate AI art or content typically don’t publicly share their AI prompts that led to those outputs. That is, even they care about privacy and protecting their bespoke AI prompts, despite not caring about the privacy or IP of the people that the AI was trained upon (which suggests hypocrisy). For anyone who claims that “privacy is dead”, just ask them for their banking or social media passwords or other sensitive personal information.*

Having read this, I think I've figured out why I dislike a certain form of photographic art: the kind that uses AI to create derivative works from existing, famous photographs, all under the pretense of “re-deconstructing history.”
In my opinion, this isn't original work at all. From the crude compositions and arbitrary alterations of original elements to the overly pretentious visual effects, the works themselves are deeply flawed. To then call them art and display them in exquisite exhibition halls feels incredibly disingenuous.

> *Having a different, special perspective will separate you from the masses who are using AI to produce more or less the same content with the same, ordinary, and generic voice. Being different and authentic would best help you to contribute new ideas to your work, not old ideas that are recycled and repackaged by AI, as well as to demonstrate your uniqueness that will be hard to replace. There’s already evidence that people are coming around to this view.*

Even with AI, a tool that can "think" for us, we still cannot give up independent thought. It's what keeps us from being trapped in a narrow information cocoon, allowing us to stay vigilant and master the technology.  

I'm reminded of a news story I saw the other day about GEO search promotion. A kindergarten in Shanghai bought a keyword on DeepSeek, so that whenever someone searches "which Shanghai international kindergarten is good," their school is ranked first. The logic behind this isn't an objective evaluation of educational quality, but a purely commercial act.
In this context, the AI algorithm is no longer a neutral tool; it has become a mouthpiece for commercial interests. It meticulously constructs an "information cocoon" to confine us within a reality of paid results.

At their core, these promotions exploit our brain's laziness. Independent thought and information retrieval skills are likely our most powerful counter-attack.



>*The good news is we have undergone such profound shi# s before. The bad news is that each time, we have failed to exploit them eff ectively. In the long run, each media revolution off ers people an entirely new perspective through which to relate to their world. Language led to shared learning, This means they have access to the capabilities given to them by others, but not the power to determine the value-creating capabilities of these technologies for themselves.*

Exactly. It’s just like with AI today. We know how to download the software and use AI to solve problems, but we don't know how it actually solves them—what the underlying model is or how it works.

This is just as the text says: “We teach kids how to use software to write, but not how to write software.” It’s also one of the reasons I want to learn about what’s behind AI. I believe only by understanding it well enough can I truly use it better.
